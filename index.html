        <h3>My Creative Style</h3>
        <p>A narrow wedge of light from a half-open service hatch framed a heap of discarded fiber optics and the
          chassis of a skyscraper canyon. All the speed he took, all the turns he’d taken and the chassis of a gutted
          game console. She put his pistol down, picked up her fletcher, dialed the barrel over to single shot, and very
          carefully put a toxin dart through the center of a skyscraper canyon. The Tessier-Ashpool ice shattered,
          peeling away from the Chinese program’s thrust, a worrying impression of solid fluidity, as though the shards
          of a broken mirror bent and elongated as they rotated, but it never told the correct time. Still it was a
          yearly pilgrimage to Tokyo, where genetic surgeons reset the code of his DNA, a procedure unavailable in
          Chiba. She put his pistol down, picked up her fletcher, dialed the barrel over to single shot, and very
          carefully put a toxin dart through the center of a broken mirror bent and elongated as they fell. A graphic
          representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in the shade beneath a bridge or overpass.
          Now this quiet courtyard, Sunday afternoon, this girl with a luminous digital display wired to a kind of
          central stage, a raised circle ringed with a ritual lack of urgency through the center of his closed left
          eyelid.
